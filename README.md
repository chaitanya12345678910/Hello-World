My name is Conor Mcgregor and I am the greatest fighter of all time. My accomplishments include being the first ever UFC two weight world champion with wins over Khabibi Nurmagomedov and Jony Bony Jonesy. I will become the heavy weight champion of the world once I wipe out the lightweight division in 2021.
